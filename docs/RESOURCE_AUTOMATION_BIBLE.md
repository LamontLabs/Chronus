# RESOURCE, CRAFTING & AUTOMATION SYSTEM BIBLE

## Resource Tiers
I Primal (Wood, Stone, Food)
II Refined (Metal, Energy)
III Cognitive (Knowledge, Culture)
IV Relic (Artifacts)
V Temporal (Chronoshards)

## Production Equations
`rate = base * (1+efficiency-entropy)`  
`offline = rate * hours * 0.9 (≤12h)`

## Automation Agents
Worker ×1.0, Drone ×1.2, AI Node ×1.5, Quantum Engine ×1.8, Omniframe ×2.0.  
Loop: collect→deposit→upgrade→log.

## Crafting Paths
Alloy→Machine Parts→Drones→Quantum Relic→Ascension Key.  
Blueprints stored `/assets/economy/crafting_recipes.yaml`.

## Maintenance
Entropy Drift −1 %/24 h; repair auto in Quantum Age.
