# AUDIO & SOUND DESIGN BIBLE

## Philosophy
Sound equals memory. Every tone confirms progress, never distracts.  
Silence is part of rhythm and recovery.

## Layers
- **Ambient Beds:** one per era (fire crackle → wind → engines → choral hum).
- **UI Feedback:** click (75–90 Hz) and success tone (400–800 Hz).
- **Music:** adaptive four-stem blend (bass, rhythm, melody, texture).
- **Events:** Relic chord, Chronostorm rumble, Prestige swell.
- **Voice:** Archive-7 AI Overseer commentary, 25 phrases/era.

## Sound Curve
- Micro (≤20 s): subtle cues  
- Short (≤10 min): motif variation  
- Medium (≤1 h): new theme  
- Volume envelope follows dopamine curve (+3 dB near milestones).

## Era Instruments
| Era | Instruments | Mood |
|------|--------------|------|
| Fire | Drums, flute | primal |
| Stone | Hand percussion | grounded |
| Bronze | Strings | progress |
| Iron | Brass, choir | power |
| Industrial | Machine rhythm | momentum |
| Digital | Synthwave | clarity |
| Quantum | Pads, fractals | curiosity |
| Ascension | Choir, harmonics | transcendence |

## Implementation
- WebAudio deterministic seed for soundtrack order.
- Reverb impulse per biome.
- Master compressor −8 LUFS; limiter −0.5 dB.
- Dynamic ducking −6 dB music under narration.
