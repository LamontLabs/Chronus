- High contrast theme.  
- Screen reader tags for all elements.  
- Voice narration for Chronicle.  
- Subtitles with adjustable opacity.  
- Tap vibration feedback ≤25 ms latency.  
- Auto-pause for timed messages.  
- Color-blind friendly palettes (Deuter, Protan, Tritan).

## Testing
All accessibility toggles regression-tested per build.

## Inclusive Design
- No gendered language.  
- Narrative decisions neutral.  
- Font: OpenDyslexic optional.  
- Audio cues duplicated visually.
